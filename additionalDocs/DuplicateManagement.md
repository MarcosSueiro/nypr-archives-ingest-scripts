# Duplicate file management at NYPR
Managing and storing duplicate audiovisual files is wasteful and expensive. We know that NYPR's internal audio file storage system, DAVID, holds many thousands of 'duplicate' WAVE files. It would be in the organization’s best interest to de-dupe these files before importing them into the new DAMS system, Cortex. How to go about it?

Successful duplicate managament involves establishing the following:
1. A _definition_ of 'duplicate files'
2. A way to _identify_ duplicate files
3. A process to _de-duplicate_ duplicate files

Let's look at these three processes in turn.

## 1. Duplicate definition

We can define two files as duplicate if they **share a particular attribute** or set of attributes. 

Different systems choose different attributes to establish duplicates. For example, most operating systems will treat these two files as duplicate:
* ```C:/myDrive/myfile.txt```
* ```C:/myDrive/MYFILE.txt```

That is, the filepaths cannot have the same 'letters', regardless of capitalization.

For NYPR assets, we propose the following definition: 

**Two audio files with the following matching attributes will be considered duplicate:**
   * **a. Sonic content**
   * **b. Published metadata**

We now define these two terms for our purposes.

#### a. Sonic content
BWF MetaEdit can [generate an MD5 hash](https://mediaarea.net/BWFMetaEdit/md5) to determine if the audio content in two files is identical, regardless of other data in the file. BWF MetaEdit can embed this MD5 hash in the file, and can also verify the data.

We have evaluated other possible attributes and combinations, including: filesize; exact duration in miliseconds; embedded UMID; filenames; UMIDs in sidecar DBX files; etc., but they all seem to produce either false positives or false negatives for our purposes.

(Incidentally, ffmpeg can generate --albeit not embed-- the same hash, provided one uses [specific options](https://superuser.com/questions/1044413/audio-md5-checksum-with-ffmpeg).)

#### b. Published metadata
The 'theme' (or 'MOTIVE') field in DAVID links an audio file to the station's CMS, Publisher, which holds metadata of interest. So it behooves us to treat two such audio files as essentially different, even if they are sonically identical.

DAVID's 'theme' can be extracted from the DAVID sidecar .DBX file.

## 2. Duplicate identification
As of April 2023, all valid WAVE files in archives-managed DAVID subfolders (plus 'News Broadcast Archives' and 'News in Progress Archives') have an embedded audio-only MD5. The metadata for all files has been exported as xml documents, one for each DAVID subfolder.

```DAVIDDupesByMD5.xsl``` identifies files with matching audio-only MD5s in those exported documents. It then looks up the corresponding DAVID sidecar .DBX file, and generates a document which groups files with matching MD5s.

As an example, ```DAVIDDupesByMD5.xsl``` has identified 2,489 sets of sonically identical files, including 3,978 potential excess files, in the DAVID subfolder 'NewsBroadcastArchives'.

At the end of this document we include a partial sample output.

- [ ] TO DO: Group by theme. 
- [ ] TO DO: Compare across folders.

## 3. De-duping
Different systems deal with potential duplicates in different ways. For instance, when you try to save a file over an existing 'identical' filepath, you may be asked to overwrite the previous file, rename it, or the system may add some characters (e.g. '(1)' or '\_01') to the end of the file.

Here is how two systems at the station deal with potential duplicates:

- _DAVID_ generates a new filepath with each new file ingestion
- _Publisher_ overwrites files coming from DAVID with the same theme

Given two sonically identical files with matching 'theme' (our suggested definition for duplicate), **we propose we keep:**

1. **The file with most complete metadata in DAVID (largest sidecar .DBX file)**; failing that, 
2. **The file with most recently updated metadata in DAVID (most recent sidecar .DBX file)**; failing that,
3. **The file most recently created**

Once the script determines which files can be erased, their filepaths can be submitted for deletion to administrators.

#### Sample matching-MD5 document

Here is an example of a set of potential duplicates generated by ```DAVIDDupesByMD5.xsl```, taking into account only the audio MD5. 

Note the different level of metadata; in this case, the suggested protocol would keep copy no. 2, which includes metadata in the ```<REMARK>``` field.

A:In the late 1960s, as pop culture embraced the sounds of rock n roll, a group of British musicians - including Nick Drake, The Incredible String Band and Vashti Bunyan - turned to the pastoral roots of 19th century English folk music for inspiration. Rob Young, editor-at-large for UK's The Wire and author of the new book, &#x93;Electric Eden: Unearthing Britain&#x92;s Visionary Music&#x94; joins us to explain the mythic roots of modern folk.
B:After a 20 year wait, the British singer and songwriter Kate Bush finally received permission to include text from James Joyce's "Ulysses" in her song "The Sensual World." Irish music critic Siobhán Kane joins us on a most hallowed day for Joyce enthusiasts - Bloomsday - to explain.
C:Jazz songstress Madeleine Peyroux has garnered many a comparison to Billie Holiday- but her newest album, &#x93;Standing On The Rooftop,&#x94; shows a rootsy, Americana side that the singer hasn't shared before. She joins us to perform songs from this album.</REMARK>
