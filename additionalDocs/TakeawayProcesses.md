# Takeaway end-of-life processes
## Intro
The Takeaway was a radio newsmagazine that broadcast between March 31, 2008 and June 2, 2023. 
The Takeaway used DAVID as a production tool.
After sunsetting the show, we wanted to make sure that NYPR had:
1. A **complete run** of all the finished product
2. Important **production files**: e.g. raw interviews
## Complete runs
- The Takeaway broadcast mostly on weekdays but it occasionally broadcast on weekends
- All of the finished products appeared to be in one of two folders: Archives_Takeaway and Archives_44k, with segments in 'TakeawayLoRes'
- Most of the weekday finished products were already in the DAMS
- No files in DAVID after October 5, 2022 (straight into DAMS)

### Process:
1. Run through all dates between March 31, 2008 and October 5, 2022
2. Search DAVID titles in DAVID folder 'Archives_Takeaway' looking for the following string matches:
    - "Takeaway", and
    - A date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD or MM-DD-YYYY
3. If not found (1,537 files --mostly week-end), search in 'Archives_44k' with date formats YYYY-MM-DD and MMDDYY (30 files found)
4. If not found but in online [schedule](https://www.wnyc.org/schedule/2023/oct/31/) (62 events), search in previous two folders using additional date formats (YYMMDD, etc.) (0 files found)
5. If not found during second attempt (1,507 dates), look for matches in DAVID folder 'TakeawayLoRes' and date formats YYYY-MM-DD, MM-DD-YYYY or MMDDYY (297 segments)

Conclusion: We may have missed most week-end broadcasts

## Matched production files
- Looking mostly for raw interviews with specific people
- 250k+ production raw files in the DAVID folder "Takeaway Lo Res" 
- Inconsistently named
- Lots of name duplicates

### Process:
1. Create a frequency list of all "words" in DAVID titles in this folder
2. From the CMS, create an entire run of published Takeaway online
3. From (2), parse out guests, identified as:
  - Listed as guests
  - Links in the CMS description
  - **Bold** in the CMS description
3. Choose files at least 5 min long within five days previous to broadcast
4. Within those files, look for last-name string match
5. Generate a [chooser html document](https://marcossueiro.github.io/takeawayChoose/) (with radio buttons):
    - Alphabetical by last name
    - Showing context
    - Show exact length, name, etc
    - Warn of common last names ("Smith")
6. A human chooses files from this list
7. Transcode/export the chosen 720 files:
    - rename them according to Archives protocol, e.g. "WNYC-TAKE-2008-10-06-w6289.2 SEGMENT RAW Uchitelle.WAV"
    - embed metadata according to Archives protocol


#### Complication: 115 "Project" files saved as multi-chunk wave files --need to export as valid WAV:
115 Files are saved as "Project" (multitrack) type. The underlying wav files are concatenated as one long WAVE file, with each 'track' separated by `<fmt >` chunks (headers) (!). See issue [here](https://github.com/MediaArea/BWFMetaEdit/issues/264)
  1. Copy DAVID title of project you are about to open from DBX file or a document such as "`takeawayFilesToCopy.xml`"
  2. Select `Takeaway Past-LoRes` folder in DAVID (you have to choose every time) and paste the title in the search field. Press ENTER
  3. In case of multiple matches, select the appropriate file by matching filename
  4. Edit "Project" file in DAVID MultiTrack editor
  5. Sort files in "clips" tab by descending length (the ones we want will usually be longest)
  6. Drag the files you want to keep to the "Save" icon ðŸ’¾ in MultiTrack
  7. Select `Disc Prod - Archives Test` as the destination folder in the popup (you **have** to choose every time)
  8. Once new take is rendered, paste the DAVID title in the `Comment:` section; repeat for each new take
  9. Go back to MultiTrack Editor, select all clips, right-click and choose "Delete all elements"; confirm
  10. Repeat from step 1

- Export 167 files (from the original 115 multitrack projects) to ARCHIVESNAS1\INGEST\01 PLEASE REVIEW\takeawayRaw\takeawayFilesExtractedFromMultitrack
- Embed metadata according to Archives protocol

- NOTE: No files longer than five minutes have any substantial descriptions (REMARK) in DAVID
 
#### Adding LCSH to exported files
1. User (Martha) chooses LCSH for each story based on subject "clusters" around CMS tags
2. (TO DO) Embed LCSH URIs in all files
