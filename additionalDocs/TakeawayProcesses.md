# Takeaway end-of-life processes
## Intro
The Takeaway was a radio newsmagazine that broadcast between XXX and XXXX. 
The Takeaway used DAVID as a production tool.
After sunset, there were two issues:
1. We wanted to make sure that we could get all the finished product
2. We wanted to make sure that we could identify production files
## Complete runs
- The Takeaway broadcast mostly on weekdays but it occasionally broadcast on weekends
- All of the finished products appeared to be in one of two folders: Archives_Takeaway and Archives_44k
- Most of the weekday finsihed products were already in the DAMS
1. We created a script that ran through all dates between XXX and XXX
2. We searched the DAVID titles in two folders looking for the following string matches:
    - "Takeaway"
    - A date formatted in one of six formats

Result: XXX files

## Matched production files
- Production raw files in the DAVID folder showed many different names
- 250k+ files
- Lots of name duplicates
1. Create an entire run of published Takeaway online
2. Parse out guests:
